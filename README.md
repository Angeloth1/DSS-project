## About

The Credit Approval DSS is developed using a comprehensive dataset from the University College London (UCL), ensuring robustness and accuracy in the decision-making process. The system evaluates various factors and responses provided by applicants to determine credit eligibility.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Credit Approval DSS project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-approval-dss.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Configure the environment settings, if required.
4. Run the application locally or deploy it to a web server.
5. Access the application through a web browser.

## Usage

Upon accessing the application, users will be presented with a series of questions. These questions cover different aspects of the applicant's financial situation. Users must provide valid responses to all the questions before submitting the form.

Once the form is submitted, the system will process the answers and display a message indicating whether the credit application is approved or not. The decision is based on predefined rules and conditions implemented in the system.
